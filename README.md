## PETR (Pose Estimation using TRansformer)
This repository contains files used in the thesis done by Yen-Lin Wu in partial fulfillment of his MSc programme in Delft University of Technology (2021), supervised by Osama Mazhar and Jens Kober. 
The thesis aims to address the widely challenged computer vision task that is Human Pose Estimation. Different from most existing methods, we propose a novel estimating technique that discards Convolution layers, using only Transformer layers.
On top of that, we integrated human anthropometric constraints to improve prediction accuracies and achieved real-time 3D human pose estimation.
